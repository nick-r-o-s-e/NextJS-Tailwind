## Project overview

My solution to a task where it was required to request data of the product list from the API and display the list with a search input and so that each product would be a link to a separate page. Main task was to use Typescript and React, fetch data from the API, and display it. As a bonus, it was required to use NextJS and TailwindCSS. I implemented the debounced search with prefetched links and also additional filtering and sorting functionality as well as pagination. For my components, I made a code snippets section for easier browsing and copying source code fetched from the GitHub repository.

This is a component that allows you to fetch code from GitHub repository and place it in tabs for viewing and copying. Loading and Error boundaries are also considered, as is a corresponding change of theme with optimized highlighting rendering. For colored code highlighting was used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter" target="_blank">react-syntax-highlighting</a> package.
